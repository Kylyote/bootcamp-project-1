## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a navigation map with an input field for location to search, WHEN a location is input with a certain distance radius, THEN a list of outdoor spaces is presented in order of shortest distance to farthest with those locations pinned, with each pin changing in size as the mouse icon is dragged over them;
- WHEN an item off that list is selected, THEN below the map a description of the park will be given including distance, access defined by multiple methods of transportation, name, and hours. A weather forecast will be presented for the selected area. A button saying go now will be presented;
- WHEN the go now button is selected; THEN the user will be sent to Google Maps to obtain navigation information.

## Work Completed

- Whenever a user visits the site, when the home page loads, the user is presented with an input box that allows for text entry of a specifc city or zipcode and a search radius defined by miles.
- When the user hits the search button, after the map page loads, a map is presented with custom markers that indicate different parks and outdoor recreation areas. The markers change size when th user hovers over them.
- The side of the map lists all the different parks that are indicated on the map. when each indicator on the map is clicked, that specific park will appear on the list as a priority piece of information.
- Under each of the park names in the list, the user can read a review of the park, view hours and operations, and can click on a link to Google Maps to grab directions to the park that the user wants to visit

## Future Developments

1. Adding Trail maps
2. Add Hiking and Climbing areas (areas more specific to outdoor activities and recreation)
3. Allowing users to input reviews, photos, and information about locations 
4. Creating an account system where a user can log in and access information 
5. Adding more resources for the user to access such as links to park area websites, nearby attractions and vendors, and nearby emergency/general medical services etc.
6. Add a library of resources for both new and experienced outdoor lovers with info such as what to take, how to be safe, and how to navigate, etc.
7. Add ability to put exact location to more accurately find the closest outdoor locations
